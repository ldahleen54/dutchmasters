# The Dutch Masters “High Noon Classic” Shooting Tournament

In 1992, Brad asked his Best Man Gregg, “that for his bachelor party that we do something quiet, like go to the farm for a campout”. Gregg took that and came up with idea of a shooting competition!  With help from Vic and Brian they developed the tournament for Brad’s bachelor party.  Vic created the first scoresheets from the only computer they had in the ink lab, so Pistol was “Sheetfed” and Shotgun was “Heatset”! 
The pistol consisted of four (4) events; Hogan’s Alley, Speed Demon, Turkey Shoot and Long Ranger which was 75 yards long in the first year!  The Shotgun was a Trap type event, using a manual thrower thrown from the ground. Except for Gary’s SUV ending up in the main ditch and thereby being totaled, the bachelor party and what would become the first Shootout was a great success!
The following year Brad took over organizing and running the tournament with help from Gregg, Vic, Brian and Paul. We knew from the very first year that drinking and shooting didn’t go together, so we set up ground rules for safety.  No drinking and shooting, guns are always considered loaded and never EVER point your gun in unsafe direction. Each year we looked at the tournament and asked what went well and what could we do better and because of that thinking the tournament has evolved greatly over the years.
Some of the changes over the years


* 1993 – Added 2nd thrower and raised the throwers 8’ off the ground
* 1993 – Shortened the Long Ranger from 75 yards to 75 feet
* 1997 – We moved to the 21-acre property
* 1998 - Gut Check - a moving target in pistol
* 1998 – Long Ranger discontinued
* 2001 - Shotgun changed to Trap & Skeet
* 2002 - Teal was added
* 2002 – Each event was awarded for the first time
* 2010 - Rabbit & (for want of a better name) Pheasant

While the pistol has been tweaked over the years, it remains basically the same.  The long ranger was replaced by “Gut Check” in 1998.  The major changes are that the shotgun is more like a sporting clay tournament.  Today we travel in groups for safety and efficiency of time and movement. The shootout has become a (family only) can’t miss weekend of shooting, fun and FOOD! 

THANKS to everyone for helping with work days, logistics, planning, new event ideas and safety!

Our motto remains…
